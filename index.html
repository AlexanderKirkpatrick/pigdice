        <h3>What are the rules of Pig Dice?</h3>
        <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
          <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's
            turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

          For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points,
          but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll
          again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence
          4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>
